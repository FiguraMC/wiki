## Getting Started

### Local Development

To set up the wiki for local development:

1. **Install [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)**: Ensure you have Git, Node.js, and pnpm installed on your machine.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Run `git clone https://github.com/FiguraMC/wiki.git` to clone the repository.
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use `cd wiki` to enter the project directory.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Execute `pnpm install` or `pnpm i` to install necessary dependencies.
