A string is a Lua value that represents a sequence of characters.

Strings are not interpreted as code and are treated as literally being characters.

Strings are used with quotation marks (")

Examples:

```lua
"hello" -- this is a string, as identified by the quotes bracketing it
hello -- not a string
```
