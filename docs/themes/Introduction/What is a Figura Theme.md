Figura Themes are Resource packs that modify how Figura looks. It can modify various things such as the GUI, Toasts, Template Textures used when making an avatar, Icons and more.

For example this theme made by [Trplnr](https://github.com/Trioplane/bedrocked-figura-theme) modifies the GUI of the Figura Menu.

You can also change how icons look, What the template textures look when making a new avatar, What the texts say and what characters are used for fonts.
