These are the loop modes a blockbench animation can be set to, they can be initialized in blockbench itself. Or changed in the code via <code>setLoop(string)</code>

<code>LOOP</code>: Plays again once it reaches the end of the timeline

<code>ONCE</code>: No looping

<code>HOLD</code>: Stays on the last keyframe of an animation
