Takes a Minecraft json string as an argument, and prints it to the chat formatted, without the lua print header

Even though the syntax says only one argument, you can put as many as you want

All of them will print, and they'll be appended in the end of the previous argument

Returns the formatted string

```lua
printJson()
```
