A table containing all the metatables for Figura's object types.

This allows you to modify the functions and properties of Figura's objects.

This table is generated at runtime based on the Figura Types available, which can change if addons are installed.

To see all metatables available, do a <code>printTable(figuraMetatables)</code> in your script body. This will show you all valid indexes.

Metatables are a complex base Lua feature which the Wiki will not be going over. [This external page can help you get started with metatables](https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html).
